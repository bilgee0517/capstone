Not only does this prove that some dinosaurs had feathers, but the widely held theory also shows that fossils cannot produce color and three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal are brown on the chest, with either colorless or pigmented colors on top.
The discovery also provides a deeper understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed main part called a tuft, but have other features such as barbs and tips, researchers conclude that tufts are a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers say that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, it indicates that it is an adult feather, not a hatchling's.
Researchers say that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows that it is the feather of an adult dinosaur, not a chicken.

Traditionally, voting in France has had little to do with technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper with their candidate choices in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the list of people eligible to vote.
French electoral law strictly regulates the trial.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can verify that there are no envelopes at the start of voting, that they have been properly counted, and that no additional envelopes have been added other than those of eligible voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision according to specific procedures.

The road at the scene of the accident was temporarily closed while emergency services extricated the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been on trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of his son.
He is being held in custody pending his indictment and trial, but his photo has been published here and there, which could negatively affect witness testimony.
This is common practice elsewhere in England, but Scottish justice operates a little differently, and the court ruled that the release of the image to the public could be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "if journalists publish images of suspects, they are walking a dangerous line."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the entire investigation, told reporters it would not comment until at least a lawsuit is filed.
This document, as it turns out, relates to the Palestinian border dispute, based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered include the future of Jerusalem, a sacred place for both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
If the agreement is signed, Israel is demanding that armed forces be stationed in the valley for ten years, while the PA has agreed to leave such a combat situation for only five years.
The additional agricultural pest control cases will be monitored and evaluated by the forest police, so the snipers in the case will be closely supervised by the forest police.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sport Shooting Association (NSW), skilled volunteers were recruited under the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage at the National Trust for Wales, said the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received detailed safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Commission (CEC) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential committee proposed that the resignation of the Evidence-Based Policy Development Committee be part of a comprehensive effort to move the country in a new direction.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The failure to hold elections since 2011 has led to some violent protests.
About 60 defective iPods have reportedly overheated, six of which caught fire, and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, Apple announced 34 cases of overheating, which it called "non-serious," according to METI.
The ministry responded by saying it was "really regrettable" that Apple was delaying its report.
The earthquake struck at 7:19 a.m. local time on Tuesday (9:19 p.m. Friday GMT).
Emergency services in the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage had been reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken hostage tourists from Hong Kong on a bus traveling to the capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and six people are confirmed dead so far.
Among the six hostages, including children and the elderly, who were released early were Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took pictures of the old woman's apartment, where she needed a toilet. Mendoza was shot and killed.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching preterm birth in her free time.
His research has shown that if the hormone is given, it accelerates the formation of the baby's embryonic lungs.
Government experts recovered two "black boxes" on Wednesday, Xinhua news agency reported.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night she was two months old. She was just as unique as she was. A strong woman."
“Luna was just as weird as I am...maybe even more so...I love her and will miss her...I hope she is in a better place,” wrote Dustin “Goldrust” Russell.
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the proportion of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percentage points since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
Similarly, 34 percent of those polled want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
Regarding the poll's extremes, 29 percent of those surveyed said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his training is in doubt following his comments.
Because he was banned from competing, he was unable to take the medication he needed to relieve his pain.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a computer science professor and mathematician at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
In early February, several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software, and announced it on Tuesday.
Along with the organic matter that forms proteins and supports life, the smoky star may have been a source of water for Earth.
Because comets collided with Earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular, how Earth formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and nonsense."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration says the NextGen system will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
This system will use satellite-based technology, compared to older ground-based radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport facilities have been provided, and the open-top train does not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available at the location.
Fears over the lack of transportation have increased the likelihood that the tournament will be played behind closed doors and without fans in attendance.
A new bird species has emerged on Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden believe that the new species evolved in just two generations, as a result of the mating of the Darwin's finches and the cactus egret found at Geospiza Castle, although they believe that the process took longer.
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes. It can be flattened into small shapes.
It can be twisted and drawn into thin threads that can be flattened. It can also be hammered or folded like a sheet.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals. It can also be made really thin and sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (since a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together with clean, damp hands, then press them into a ball shape.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layer, creating a strange, sticky coating.
Almost every household in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a latrine connected to a modern sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilet was a part of a public bathhouse where men and women mixed and bathed together.
When you talk to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space picks up your call and translates it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some light and images.
A large rocket needs to reach a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the bicycle has given us is a simpler and faster means of transportation.
It brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
After them, come the more average-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to gazelles and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including fluffy domestic cats) that eat a wide variety of small prey, including insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success was the concept of a hideout with a specific task that each cat could do without competing with the others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult male lions and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females often bond closely with each other, forming large herds of females.
A lion pride is surprisingly similar in behavior to a pack of wolves or dogs (not other big cats) and poses a deadly threat to its prey.
A consummate athlete, a tiger can climb (though not very well), leap great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same family (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and snow leopards.  These four cats are the only species that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's full-throated roar, but rather like angry, screaming words uttered in sentences.
Wild cats like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds if they can. Almost all the animals that wild cats catch are much smaller than these.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow animals (prey) by scent, finding and eating them by sniffing where they are on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and can move very stealthily. Wild cats hunt their prey by adapting their color to their surroundings and attacking them suddenly.
When a group of animals (small in number) separates from their original species (e.g., moving to a mountainous region, a river basin, or a new island, where they cannot return), they often have to adapt to a different environment than they were before.
Because this new environment has different resources and different competitors, the new population will need different traits or adaptations to become stronger competitors than what was needed before.
The core population has not changed at all and still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations adapt to their new environment, they gradually begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process of new species formation speciation. The formation of species is an inevitable consequence of evolution and is a very important part of it.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (yes, exhale).
Plants get their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also create shade.
We build our houses with plants, we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals could not live.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time and was not afraid of anything other than other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth and an extra part of its mouth, which means that there is no escape for anything that enters its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
This animal also attacked anything that entered the water, even a giant dinosaur, the T-rex, that was no match for it.
Most of the Roman foods are familiar to us, but they also shared some strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the wood dormouse.
Another difference is that while poor people and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked to sit together and eat their meals and have dinners.
The ancient Roman diet did not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built major temples for each of their gods, which they considered the home of the gods.
People bring offerings to the gods, and monks try to take care of the gods' needs through festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctum where only monks can enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
There was a sacred place dedicated to God on top of the tower.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not very important.
Much of Jewish family life took place in the open air.
Women cooked in their courtyards, shops were just open stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norse mythology, Erik the Red is said to have been exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he found Greenland, which he named Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were very different.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of a Nation, you might think of the treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "The Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776." The text is written upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows who wrote it, but it is known that this large parchment document (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was originally stored in a scroll.
So the note is simply added as a symbol.
The D-Day operation and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south remained unliberated.
The area was ruled by the "Vichy" French, the French who in the 1940s made friends with the Germans and collaborated with them instead of fighting the occupiers.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, calling the operation "Operation Punishment".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French Liberation Forces had liberated southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
Citizenship is a single culture shared by a specific large group of people, or society, who live and work together.
Civilization comes from the Latin words civilis, meaning civil, civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state, and it also describes the size of society in some way.
The state of the city is a signal of the people. The culture of citizenship implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, the preservation of cultural traces, and the equitable distribution of heritage.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any evidence of their associated history and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially established a weak central government due to the sole composition of Congress under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, as there was no national executive or judicial branch, and the enforcement of laws was left to the less cooperative state governments.
It also did not have the authority to repeal interstate tax laws and tariffs.
The agreement required unanimous approval from all the states before any amendments could be made, and the states took the central government too lightly, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is ranked as the second most successful team in the world, having won the World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
The Japanese occupy almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is geographically called an "archipelago" because of its island group/group.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formoso, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated efforts to change native crop processing practices, employing Chinese workers in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly seized control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, including the Temple of the Sun, or Intihuatana, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex were built to give tourists a better idea of how it originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been adopted as a digital camera image sensor format.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm tall, which is somewhat confusing.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many popular formats (such as the APS group of formats) are approximately equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of three, often mocked and ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining the order of the lines in an image.
This determines that the most effective area for the main subject is at the intersection of the image, where it is divided into thirds horizontally and vertically (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful at this time in European history, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European countries with different languages and customs.
It had a strong impact on everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the core beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds exist specifically for that purpose.
The central leadership of the Church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether that faith is being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of war, Britain took the initiative to blockade the German navy.
Cutting off vital military and civilian supplies violates several international treaties made and ratified over the past two centuries, but the strategy has proven to be effective.
Britain's mining of international waters, preventing any ships from entering all parts of the sea, posed a threat even to neutral ships.
The response to this tactic was limited, and Germany anticipated a similar response to its submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the brutality and horror of World War I, countries wanted to avoid such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different eras; each period of China or each ruling family had its own state.
It was an unstable era of division between dynasties. The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Throughout these ages, fierce wars were fought among the many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was the bloodiest period in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people died to secure high positions in the high court of Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolute monarchy to nationalism, and the shift from authoritarianism to the rule of the people rather than a single individual.
After the revolution, all jobs were open to male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
It's the same for the military, because instead of being based on class, army ranks are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this world. He would often meditate in a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light).
Sitting in a cave that has survived to this day provides a very clear illustration of Muhammad's spiritual talents and interests.
The cave, located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even if you knew that such a thing existed in reality, it wouldn't be easy to find. You only get complete isolation when you enter a cave.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis", near Death Valley in Egypt, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid is the largest), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "upward-facing string" symbol looks like a V, and the "downward-facing string" symbol looks like a staple or square with the bottom missing.
Up means starting to pull from the tip of the bow, and down means starting to pull from the noose (the part of the bow that your hand holds).
Buds facing up usually produce softer sounds, while buds facing down produce stronger, more energetic sounds.
Mark it yourself, but printed symbols should be considered often because they are related to music.
The terrified King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forcibly taken from Versailles to Paris by a group of women from the suburbs on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
A group of people forced the King and Queen to leave the windows of their carriage open.
At one point, a member of the group was waving the head of a Royal Guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid the costs of the US imperialist war to conquer the Philippines.
They were forced to pay a large portion of the costs of the US colonial regime by levying taxes, and the interest rates on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government fluctuated freely through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits from the prolonged oppression and exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the main source of income for US imperialism.
To understand the temple, one must understand the idea that motivated its construction.
The era in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages of European history, during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 BC).
The High Middle Ages is the period between the Early Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages, which is considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of practical ideas, with the strict meaning that human destiny follows a logical path related to scientific laws and their technological expressions, starting from the impetus or significance of technology.
Most translations of the definition of technology share two general ideas: that technological development follows its own path, independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology, in turn, "influences" the society in which it is embedded, rather than being formally conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the motor inevitably led to the development of roads.
However, since the country's road network is only economically feasible for a small number of cars, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership.
Increased car ownership leads to higher rates of road accidents and also to the development of new healthcare technologies to repair injured human bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural definition, inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged in interaction with society, rather than arbitrarily imposed laws.
While Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
The city was known as the epicenter of luxury, beginning around 400 BC and lasting until around 1100 BC.
The city's status declined in the twelfth century, as the Crusaders returned with gifts of silver and spices that were more valuable than the Byzantine market could offer.
At this time, events took place that led to the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture in the East had a significant influence on dress.
However, because communication channels were slow, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style. As a result of the Crusades, one of the biggest developments of the time was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that is conducted solely for the purpose of producing enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system of preserving the seeds of the region's own crops, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have relied on agriculture for their livelihood, and this remains the case in many developed countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel marginalized by societal standards and allow them to develop their individuality.
Subcultures can be unique due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and gender of their members.
The quality that defines a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these.
Members of subcultures often express their style in unique and symbolic ways, including fashion, style, and idiomatic expressions.
One of the most commonly used ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to consider a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized as they grew up, either through neglect, misadventure, or deliberate humiliation by adults.
Such children are called "wild" or feral. Some wild children were abandoned by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of such children was due to the parents' refusal to accept the child's serious mental or physical disabilities.
Aggressive children are likely to have experienced childhood abuse and trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Others are said to have been brought by animals; some are even said to have lived in the wild themselves.
When non-human animals raise children, the wild-raised child exhibits almost all of the animal's behaviors (within physical limitations), such as fear and indifference.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more engaging, scaling up is just one step beyond that.
Stepping up is not a method of learning, but rather a support system that supports people going through new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Hierarchy can be virtual or real, meaning that a teacher is a form of hierarchy but is a little paper man working in Microsoft Office.
A virtual hierarchy is embedded within the software and is designed to prompt and explain procedures that a student may have difficulty completing on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even threats of robbery.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where they are not nurtured, cared for, and educated, yet this situation continues to exist.
We view the child-rearing system of others as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system aims to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care aims to provide all the needs that children could not have in their previous families.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique nature of the Internet leads to additional dimensions in terms of usage and norms.
For example, “learning” and “socializing” are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Personal involvement and "continuing relationships" have also been identified as new aspects of activation by Eigmey and McCord (1998) when studying the impact of user responses to websites.
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is believed that by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
In his book, The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks describes how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage can accurately assess sincerity.
He believed that even animals, such as domestic dogs, were capable of such skills in interpreting and translating human behavior.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
A mutation adds a new genetic variant, the option to remove it from the pool of expressed variants.
There is a need for periodic allocation, reallocation, and coordination between water resources.
When traveling in the savannah, it is difficult for a bison, which has a human-like digestive system, to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth failure, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant-based sources are plant-based proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest unless consumed by animals like us.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) provide a high amount of protein that is not only easily digestible, but also contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors managed their "protein problem" in a way that's somewhat similar to how monkeys in the rainforest get their protein today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and then falling asleep for a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you are adjusting your clock to your sleep, placing it on the other side of the room can force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based methods include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or teas that are said to be diuretics) before bed and forcing yourself to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is proportional to the effort they put into their body and spirit.
The less anxiety there is, the more positive the power of life in the present moment becomes. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and tranquility.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own efforts and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist teachings, but is enriched with the Mahayana path of love and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of loving-kindness to all.
Kundalini yoga and Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) are revived through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of Perfect Enlightenment. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was the main enemy that led to the USSR and the United States becoming allies in World War II. When the war ended and the system collapsed, processes and cultures led to the division of countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
The Cold War was expected to continue for the next 40 years, with active armies fighting in real-life situations in many different places, from Africa to Asia, and in Afghanistan to Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had been breached, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were rendered useless almost overnight when the Soviet Union, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilingual and multilingual international agreements, invaded eastern Poland and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts, bringing in 800,000 more Red Army troops.
Using ships to transport goods is probably the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The job of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure the ability to transport its own people and goods, while also confronting the ability of its enemy to transport its own people and goods.
The most famous recent example of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, when the Americans attempted to send troops and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
The German navy, which at the time mainly used U-boats, tried to stop this movement.
If the Allies were defeated, Germany, which had occupied the rest of Europe, could have conquered Britain.
Goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes raised goats for their milk, wool, meat, and easy access to skin.
Domestic goats are usually herded in herds on hills or other pastures, often by children or teenagers who become goatherds, or more commonly known as shepherds. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagon roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon track consisted of only parallel logs, it allowed the horses to go faster and pull larger loads over less difficult terrain.
Railroad ties were introduced early on to hold roads in place. It was later realized that roads would be more efficient if they had a steel section on top.
This became a common practice, but the wooden wheels of the wagons wore out more than the iron ones.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete railway was inaugurated.
The first known means of transportation was walking. With the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright), humans began walking upright about two million years ago.
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal forms have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, while Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, join environmental movements, and even become activists to help reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is just a symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and disable it.
It is clear enough that the world has changed greatly due to human scientific and technological advancements, and the problems are becoming increasingly serious due to overpopulation and humanity's increasingly wasteful lifestyle.
After Congress began implementing it on July 4, a draft of the manuscript, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop.
Between 150 and 200 copies were printed overnight, now known as the "Dunlap Page."
The document was first read by John Nixon on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 known copies of the first edition of the Declaration of Independence are the oldest surviving versions of the document. No original handwritten copies survive.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
People don't think of themselves as the same as dinosaurs just because they have feathers and can fly.
But many bird species still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly, clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
In fact, all computers in use today are based on the complexity of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits, which are used in computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are often general enough to make a direct diagnosis difficult.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists to formally name this group of insects.
The term originated from an ancient association with the bloodsucker, an insect that feeds on human blood.
Assassin bugs and ticks are nesting, and have adapted to living in nests or houses in their native habitat.
With an estimated 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, it is the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child may not be in their or their child's best interests.
These couples may choose to plan for adoption.
In adoption, birth parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing them to raise another child.
The main goal of science is to discover how the world works through scientific investigation. This evidence-based approach is the most scientific of all.
This is not the only thing, but conducting an experiment, an experiment is an attempt to rule out one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions, making observations, and guiding scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
He accepted all of Aristotle's ideas about all things scientific, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
The rhythms often observed in the body and in behavior are endogenous cycles, and their formation through the biological clock is crucial.
Regular circadian rhythms, which are not simply responses to external cyclical signals, have been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is an independent signal generator that continues the cycle of free-running cycles even in the absence of external cycles.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the key experiments that suggested that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to transfer their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the radioactive sulfur in the phage protein.
The consequences of a mutation vary depending on the type of mutation, such as the importance of the genetic part of the cell affected and whether the affected cell is a bacterial cell.
Only mutations in bacterial cells can be passed on to children, and other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the spectacle, including wild life of plants and animals.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about ecosystems.
One example is visiting Borneo, taking pictures, and learning about orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from small towns to work, and they are met by other people whose jobs are in the same area they just left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is connected in some way and supports a transportation system based on personal cars.
This giant carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of its stable state and supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you'll occasionally hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do vehicle systems generate so many complaints, and why do they fail to deliver basic everyday things? Are vehicle engineers incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, because drivers behave in a relatively consistent manner, traffic flows tend to be relatively stable and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three main indicators: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) frequency.
These connections contribute to the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
The first animals to take to the air were insects. Their ability to fly helped them more easily capture enemies, find food, and reproduce more efficiently.
Most insects have the unique ability to fold their wings backward along their body.
This gives them a wide range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot retract their wings today are wasps and flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people believed he was right, but many people believed the opposite, which was that the solar system, including the Sun (and other stars), revolved around the Earth.
This is possible because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It holds 8 times the volume of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, reaching up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River basin is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long. It receives its water from thousands of tributaries.
The construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but they never surpassed the pyramids of Giza in size or technical perfection.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt boasted monuments from previous kingdoms that were over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of approximately 800 people. It is the smallest sovereign state and the least populous country in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian for its laws and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language used by most people working in the province, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Because they are found naturally and are relatively easy to extract with simple tools, people were aware of the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and ancient copper.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter is made up of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Although he also theorized that these change into new substances to create the things we see, this was similar to the four basic states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of atoms could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil was invented, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the position and use of the pencil declined.
People now type messages on computer screens, so the senders never have to get close again.
I wonder what will happen to the computer keyboard when something new comes out.
An atomic bomb works on the principle of using energy to fuse atomic nuclei using a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy load up a hill. When the nucleus splits, some of that energy is then released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the mantle.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner in lowlands, while it is thicker in mountainous areas.
The crust is thinner, so it may be more patchy on the near side. It was easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what makes people tick and what grabs their attention.
These theories assume that there are certain desires and/or needs that are established within a person from the time they reach adulthood.
These theories are about specific people who have come to want to do what they do, and what things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
There are two common themes in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start to lead their peers, two behaviors emerge. One is to try to remain "one of the guys (or girls)."
This type of manager has difficulty making unfamiliar decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, the person becomes unrecognizable, a person who believes they must change everything the team does and make it their own.
Ultimately, the success or failure of a team is the responsibility of the leader.
This behavior creates a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same high standards as traditional teams, but with a few differences.
Virtual team members often act as points of contact for the physical group with whom they interact directly.
They have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams meet across different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
A unique component of a virtual team is the presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The "invisible team" in a management team is the team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would any organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One goal of implementing the concept of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
Creativity and innovation become evident when all available resources are effectively utilized across the organization's operational departments.
As a result, the process of organizations working together to overcome obstacles can lead to innovative processes that meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) describes the Continuum Approach as a method used to help organizations achieve high levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide empirical evidence for theoretical approaches to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows and makes the area of research more specific.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is supported by scientific research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, mental disorders, trauma, and cancer can cause changes in some mental functions and affect behavior.
The rise of new technology is allowing us to see and study the structure and processes of the brain like never before. It sounds more natural.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation of fantasy, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the integration of behavior, learning, and memory in machines.
Research at the University of Illinois includes automating machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and answer user questions, as well as the ability to recognize handwriting, voice and facial expressions.
These are separate principles that focus on finding solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems, once used in a few home computers and video game software applications, are now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Teachers often like to take their students to places they wouldn't otherwise be able to travel to by bus.
Technology offers a solution for virtual production practices. Students can view museum exhibits, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art from the comfort of their own classrooms.
Taking a field trip together virtually is a great way to understand and share experiences with your classmates about future trips.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, redesigning the website each year, but keeping the old version online as a draft.
Blogging helps students improve their writing skills. Students begin their blogging experience with grammar and spelling errors, which are generally corrected by their readers.
Since students are the most problematic audience, bloggers start trying to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
Blogging also requires students to “become more aware of the world around them.” The need to cater to the interests of their audience encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "enables students to become more analytical, critical, and supportive by actively responding to online materials. Students can identify their own positions in the context of others' posts and learn to define their own positions on specific issues" (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city, distinguished by its art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the Muskoka region and beyond, a region of untouched natural beauty.
All of these and other distinctive features of Ontario are considered by outsiders to be unique to Canada.
The large areas in the north are relatively sparsely populated, and some areas are virtually uninhabited and unspoiled.
The population comparison that more African Americans live in the United States than Canadians may surprise many.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are either independent nations or are affiliated with France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the area, greatly influencing the way the Comoros and Mayotte were established.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is surrounded by the Sahel, while to the south and west it is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (just not an expensive one).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to perceived insults, and that following, holding hands, etc. are not uncommon.
Be confident when rejecting men's offers, and don't be afraid to defend your position (whether or not there are cultural differences doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but it was abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Daru I-Badia, and Spanish traders who established their trading posts there gave the city the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least attractive places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find stalls selling traditional Moroccan goods, including tajine dishes, pottery, leather goods, khakis, and a wide range of beautiful exotic items, all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Neiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying the streets of much of the city, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside of Goma should be aware of and research the ongoing fighting in North Kivu.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along the cheapest mountain gorilla route in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). A typical (local) fare is ~500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative invulnerability, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for a strange, remote place.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation still attracts tourists and it has an airport.
In 1990, the site was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
This was one of the main stops during the PBS special, Wonders of the African World, featuring Henry Louis Gates.
The city is very different from the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab-style character than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-regions, each supporting distinct wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the finest of the South African National Parks (SAN).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation activities and park entrance fees.
It can be beneficial for anyone to purchase a Wildlife Card, which gives you the option to enter South African parks or all of South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives Hong Kong its name and is a major tourist destination.
The list of Hong Kong's skyscrapers has been compared to the shimmering silhouettes of Victoria Harbour, clearly visible in the water.
To see the best of Hong Kong, head off the island and head to the Kowloon Harbour District on the opposite side.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is a place that was claimed by British colonists, and it's a great place to visit if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from Bangladesh to the interior coast of India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian portion of the forest is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Although there are some last remnants of the vast jungle that once covered the Gangetic plains, the forest is not just a forest canopy.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², one-third of which is covered by water/marshland.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is now estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and over 30,000 deer there.
Buses run throughout the day from bus stations within the district (across the river), but most depart east to Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is recommended to buy your tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by comfortable and powerful Japanese coastal minibuses.
Shared taxis are quick and convenient for traveling to nearby destinations such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu200).
The Oiapoc River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoc River, connecting the cities of Oiapoc, Brazil, and the Saint-Georges de L'Oiapoc area in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two aisles, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011 and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaicuru and Payagua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, or the "Giant Province of the Indians" as it was previously called, was formed as a result of Spanish conquistadors' clashes with the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain its indigenous identity and identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament information and where to buy polo tickets, see the Argentine Polo Federation.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and the Stanley credit card and the United States dollar are also commonly accepted.
On remote islands, British and American currency may be accepted, but credit cards may not be accepted, so check with the owners in advance to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the island, so exchange your money before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is in the southern part of Ecuador, when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer here, and when it's summer there, it's winter here.
Montevideo is a hot region, and temperatures often reach +30 degrees Celsius during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: the temperature is below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "rainy" or "dry" season: the amount of rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year.
Many animals in the park are used to being seen by humans, but the wild is inevitably wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park management, stay 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may appear, almost any large animal, including bull deer, elk, moose, and bears, can attack.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they don't keep the proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, avoid carrying or cooking foods that smell good, and keep your accommodation clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The coast was the site of a famous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the coast.
All but one British cruiser was sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
A peaceful protest in the city during the Mau movement's struggle for independence led to the death of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese III Lealofi.
Auckland is a city that stretches between two harbors, so it has many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (Northern Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming areas, and many are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on Waitemata Harbour, in Mission Bay and in the suburbs of St Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are family-friendly beaches with good shops lining the shore. They are safe for swimming.
The main local beer is "Number One", which is not a strong beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better for long-distance travel.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're concerned, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, "plain, white" coffee is a thing of the past. A small black is an "espresso" while a cappuccino is served with a heap of cream (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standard. The fruit juice is expensive but very good.
Trips to the underwater reef are made many times throughout the year, and injuries from underwater reefs are rare.
However, please seek advice from management, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box turtle is found near the coast and in rivers from October to April 1770. It is found sporadically at other times.
Giant fish do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most giant fish are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean, their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodations, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even a combination of flights and hotels.
They can also hold your order if you need time to consider the offer or purchase other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any changes or requests should be handled first by the travel agent, not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to stay at the venue, and most attendees consider this a necessity.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive early to get a place to stay close to the music.
Even though the music on the main stage has ended, there may be sections of the festival where music continues until midnight.
Some festivals have special tent pitches for families with young children.
If crossing the North Baltic Strait in winter, check the location of the cabin, as ice makes very dangerous noises.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include a stay in the city. Cruises exempt passengers from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos make every effort to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. There are often no windows or clocks, and it is difficult to find the exit.
They often take special orders for food, drinks, and entertainment, making guests feel welcome and making them feel like they are still there.
Some venues offer alcohol, although most good players know that staying healthy is important, as alcohol can impair judgment.
Anyone planning to drive through high altitude areas or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
There is less friction on icy and snowy roads, so you can't drive as well as you would on paved roads.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow, blowing snow, frosted or ice-covered vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and road traffic generally continues without any disruptions year-round.
Safari is a great attraction for tourism to Africa, and many travelers are attracted to it.
The word safari generally refers to a journey to see the magnificent wilderness of Africa, especially the tropical rainforests.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles and can be observed closely with standard equipment.
Lions, leopards, and snow leopards are sometimes shy, and you will see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "bush walking", "safari walking" or "backpacking") consists of walking for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo became the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics when it hosted the Games in 1964.
If you had booked flights and accommodations for your 2020 trip before the extension was announced, you are in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies from late March will not be extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket estimated to be around 7,000 yen.
Wet clothes are ironed and dried. Many hotels offer irons and ironing boards, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron and you don't like wearing ironed socks, try using a hair dryer if possible.
Be careful not to get the fabric too hot (otherwise it will shrink and cause serious burns).
There are many different ways to disinfect water, some of which are more effective against certain hazards.
In some places, one minute is enough to boil water, while in other areas it may take several minutes.
Filters are known for their efficiency, and if you have any concerns, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests from animals that are unfamiliar to their home countries.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, and transmit infections.
Dangerous animals that can cause infectious diseases or cause serious harm or death to humans are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase special and other tax-exempt goods at specific locations.
Travelers who travel to countries with high taxes can save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is one of the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often winding through desolate pine forests.
If you haven't learned to drive on country roads, keep in mind that steep sections, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The posted speed limit is noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections, typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and it is more important to adhere to this speed limit.
But surprisingly, the cell phone service here is much stronger than in many other areas along the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite good, and Bavaria is very rich and varied, similar to its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries made with apples are popular throughout the year, and cherries and plums are baked into pastries in the summer.
Many pastries made in Germany contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. The popular pastries often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you're craving a small but rich baked good, try Berliner, Pannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, eaten with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be “dry” or “liquid.”
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, ghee is widely used in curries; in South India and the coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut juice is widely used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that refers to the diverse regional cuisines across the country.
However, when used without a specific qualifier, the term refers to food originating from the eastern and central parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the island group, consists of simple, flavorful dishes, with flavors that are popular in Javanese cuisine including peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and a variety of aromatic spices.
The pedals are the support for the rider's feet and are suspended on either side of the saddle.
They provide great stability for the rider, but there is a risk of the rider's feet getting stuck in them, so safety precautions are needed.
If a rider falls off a horse and their foot gets caught in the stirrups, there is a risk of being dragged by the horse. There are several safety precautions that can be taken to reduce this risk.
At first, most riders wear special shoes with heels, spikes, and fairly thin soles.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have a safety strap with a leather section that falls off the saddle when the rider pulls back.
The Cochamo Valley - Chile's main mountain climbing area, known as the Yosemite of South America, is home to large walls and cliffs of various granite types.
The peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly carving out new routes amidst the endless possibilities of the walls.
Downhill snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski-hikers," plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific location, so skiing is the main activity of the trip.
The idea of skiing is very old, with cave paintings depicting people skiing dating back to 5,000 BC.
Downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first resort ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called ski touring, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It's not usually an alpine ski tour or mountaineering, but it's related, and the subsequent steep terrain required stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover much greater distances than you can on foot, but the speed of skis across the entire area is achievable if you walk on a paved trail without a backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it is home to many independent countries. Traveling to many countries usually means applying for multiple visas and going through passport control multiple times.
However, the Schengen area functions like a single country to some extent in this regard.
